# ColoredQR
We are all familiar with QR codes. They are convenient for paying for a ride on the metro or confirming receipt of a visa, for example. In 2020, they were actively used to enter crowded places.
But, despite the fact that QR codes can be VERY large, they have the same problem - not enough fields for data. Of course, there are not many people who use huge (regular) QR codes in practice, and such sizes are rare in themselves. 
However, what should you do if, for example, you need to give an X-ray to a doctor, but this (physical) image is lost? In this case, you can show the ColoredQR-code to the doctor from your phone, and the doctor will have the picture in a few moments, and it will turn out that, thank God, you do not have appendicitis.
There is currently no code for this project, but I am ready to announce the main characteristics of my second-generation QR code, if I may say so.
The basic operating principle of such a QR code will be to store more data on one pixel. I'll tell you about the rest... but a little later.

Stay tuned <3
